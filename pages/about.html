          Hello and thanks for visiting my site! My name is Ryan, I am an
          aspiring software engineer/video game developer/web developer/data
          analyst...anything that involves programming, coding, data modeling,
          and problem solving is something that I would love to do. I am a US
          Air Force veteran. While in the Air Force I served as a 1N1X1A -
          Geospatial Intelligence Analyst. After completing my time in the
          military, I was able to return to school for a second degree (in
          Comupter Science) which I am very grateful that I was given the
          opportunity to do so, and also so glad that I committed to learning
          about Computer Science and programming. I also have a degree in
          Business Management and a minor in Mathematics. I prefer not to have
          much of a social media presence, but if you are a potential employer
          then you have my LinkedIn profile.

          After completing my Computer Science degree, I worked as a teacher
          with the
          <a href="https://icodeschool.com/" class="p-link">iCode</a> School
          franchise. iCode is an after-school program that teaches kids various
          programming topics and principles (like web development, game design,
          data science, object-oriented programming, and several programming
          languages). iCode also teaches several other STEM subjects, such as
          robotics, math, and physics. Working at iCode was a great opportunity
          to continue to expand my programming knowledge and reinforce the
          skills that I, myself, have learned.

          here twice. Texas State may not have the notoriety of some other big
          colleges around Texas, but according to

            class="p-link"
            >collegefactual.com</a
          >, Texas State ranks as the #3 university in Texas for best schools
          for Computer Science. I have enjoyed my time as a Bobcat a lot, and
          earned bachelor's degrees in Business Management and Computer Science,
          with a minor in Mathematics.<br /><br />

          a brief overview is that the analysts receive images taken by various
          methods, then analyze and exploit the images to generate critical,
          time-sensitive intelligence reports, and sending them to relevant
          parties or agencies. Geospatial Analysts may also be responsible for
          observing and monitoring the live-feed from other aircraft as well,
          and participating in reconnaissance missions. Serving in the military
          was one of the most worthwhile endeavors I have undertaken in my life
          so far, and I am proud to be able to call myself a veteran.

        <p class="about-section-desc">Of course, I am passionate about coding and enthusiastic about learning new programming concepts and tools. Currently I am trying to improve my front-end skills and gain some exposure to frameworks and libraries like React. I would also like to become more well-versed in back-end programming but am a little unsure as to best-practices in that regard. I also enjoy gaming (probably a little too much), and I've started delving into learning about game development. I have been working with Unity Engine and Blender 3D modeling software, and I hope to have a working demo of a game available soon for others to see. When I'm not behind a monitor I do enjoy lifting weights or getting out to play some tennis. I don't really have a lot to say about myself though, so if you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to check out my page!</p>
