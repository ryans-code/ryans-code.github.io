          Like everyone, I have enjoyed many games throughout my life, but some have stuck with me over the years and keep me coming back time and time again. This page highlights some of my favorite games and describes different aspects that I love about them. To be clear, this is not a list of 'greatest games of all time,' rather, this is a list of games that I enjoy a lot and that resonate with me and I have invested considerably more time into them than others.

        <div class="games-split">
          <p class="split-desc">This should come as a surprise to no one. What can be said about this game that hasn't been said a million times before? Final Fantasy VII was one of the most impactful games of a generation and for many, served as an introduction to the Final Fantasy series. For the time, FFVII pushed the boundaries of what games were capable of and raised the bar, setting a new standard for the games industry as a whole. FFVII has one of the most iconic cast of characters in video game history with a riveting and immersive story, making this one of the most memorable entries in the entire series. While groundbreaking for its time, some parts of this game haven't aged well. However, I believe that the key aspects that put this game on the map and elevated it to such legendary status still hold up to this day; from the beloved roster of characters, to the gripping and intriguing story, to the fully-customizable and engaging materia (magic) system, to the absolutely masterful soundtrack that accompanies the game. Final Fantasy VII is so adored by fans that it has spawned numerous spin-off games and movies, and even a modern-day remake of the game, but in my opinion, none of them can live up to the charm and remarkability that the original game encapsulates. Final Fantasy VII checks all the right boxes even to this day, which is why I still hold this game in such high regard and it firmly stands as my personal favorite game of all time.</p>

        <div class="games-split">
          <p class="split-desc">Imagine it is the year 2000, the internet is still young and online gaming is almost unheard of, except for some PC games. Occasionally, a new fighting game banger like Marvel vs Capcom 2 or Street Fighter III: Third Strike might drop in your local arcade, but in reality, fighting games are about to be banished to the shadow realm and forgotton about and fade into a memory for most of us. Now fast-forward to 2009, the internet has grown exponentially, every modern game console has network capabilities. Then, after nearly a decade of fighting game silence, Street Fighter IV appears out of nowhere to single-handedly resurrect the entire genre.This game was just awesome! The visuals and audio was aggressive and in-your-face, the colors popped, attacks had deep, bassy, satisfying *thud* sounds, and there were awesome new effects like the paintbrush smudges used to emphasize the force of impact from attacks landing, and the awesome, cinematic, cutscene-style ultra moves. Street Fighter IV also gave us the iconic "VS" paint splash that you see everywhere on the internet today. Not to mention, this is the first time for many of us that we could pick up a controller and fight against someone else across the country, and competition out there was fierce! It seems like everyone was playing this game and it really did revitalize the fighting game industry and brought in a lot of new attention and talent to the fighting game community. Street Fighter IV has been through a few different revisions to adjust the game's balance and implement new characters, and I have enjoyed all of them. I like the Street Fighter IV family of games a lot and have even won a few local tournaments so Street Fighter IV had to have a spot on my list of awesome games!</p>

        <div class="games-split">
          <p class="split-desc">Wait, Diablo III is on this list? Seriously? Well stay a while and listen! Yeah, I am aware that this game didn't have the greatest launch. Yeah, I am aware that long-time veterans of the series did not much care for this game. Blizzard did make some new decisions with this entry that were not always popular with the community, but here's the thing; this was my first experience playing a Diablo game (in fact, this was one of my first PC games for that matter). I never played Diablo or Diablo II, so I didn't have any preexisting expectations from the previous games. As a new player, it was really fun to wipe out hordes of enemies in search of equipment upgrades. Diablo III was my first experience playing a randomized loot farming game, learning about min-maxing a character, and learning a lot about RPG concepts that I didn't know about before. A year later, Blizzard released an expansion for the game that addressed a lot of the gripes that many of the players had and completely reworked the balance of the game and end-game experience, and then some time later, Blizzard introduced seasons as a way to keep the gameplay fresh and interesting. The seasons would often feature unique buffs or themes for a limited time, and would often redesign or introduce new character builds. I have always enjoyed seeing the creativity of the Diablo III team when a new season starts, and this is a game that I still play even to this day. Just by the sheer number of hours alone that I have sunk into this game earns Diablo III a spot on my list of awesome games. Additionally, I play this game on PC and console, and I truly believe that Diablo III is one of the best couch co-op games available on console to date.</p>

        <img src="/images/nioh.png" class="nioh-img" />
        <div class="games-split">
          <p class="split-desc">Nioh is tragically underrated and never really got the attention that it deserved. Some may think that this game is just another Soulsborne knockoff but Nioh has a lot going for it. Nioh is a beautiful game, the art direction and music are captivating, but don't let all the pleasantries fool you. It won't take long to discover that Nioh, at its core, is a brutally difficult game. A lot of players may have been put off for that reason. What could be so enjoyable about a difficult game like this? Yes, it is tough, but it also has in-depth character building, equipment crafting, and really well designed customization. Taking the time to learn about what is available as the game progresses will really mitigate the difficulty and allow players to appreciate the game for all that it is. One weak point that I would have to critique about this game though, is the presentation of the story. There are times when I just didn't know what was going on until I played through the game a couple of times. Weaknesses aside, the best and most addictive part of Nioh is the combat. Yeah, they can add as many RPG mechanics to this game as they desire, but the combat is where this game really shines. It just feels so refined and polished and responsive, I can just get lost in this game for hours. It is so satisfying to take down a difficult boss because you know your combat execution was perfect. There are several weapon-types to use in this game, as well as a stance system, all with their own strengths and weaknesses, which allows for a huge amount of combat variety. There is quite a lot of additional content to this game and I still find myself going back to it so it just wouldn't feel right not to include it on my list of awesome games!
